## BackStory

My son is fascinated with all things about dinosaurs.
So, I built a ðŸ¦– ðŸ¦• classifier for him as homework for the first week of the fastai 2022 cohort.
Choose from examples or upload image of an dinosaur from below categories to find out its name.

## Collecting Dinosaur Images

200 images from each of the below categories were downloaded from duckduckgo inspired by Jeremy Howard Kaggle [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data).

- Pteradactyl 
- Parasaurolophus
- Triceratops
- Brachiosaurus
- Stegosaurus
- T-rex
- Gigantosaurus

### Datablock code 

```
dls = DataBlock(
    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), 
    get_items=get_image_files, 
    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),
    get_y=parent_label,
    item_tfms=[Resize(256)],
    batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224),
).dataloaders(path)

dls.show_batch(max_n=12)
```

## Training 

A `seresnext50_32x4d` model was finetuned on the dataset for 20 epochs. 
Since the dataset was complex, adding data augmentation to the datablock improved the results.

## Observations

- The dataset is very noisy, and is different from imagenet
- The model finds hard to differntiate between `gigantosaurus` and `T-rex` since they are so similar.
